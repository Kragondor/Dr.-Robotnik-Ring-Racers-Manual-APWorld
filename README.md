Good Morning, Evening, or Night to Everyone
This is the manual APworld for the fangame called Dr. Robotnik's Ring racers, i'll explain the checks, progression, & other stuuf later in this message, starting with...

--Checks
for the checks at the current moment we got only Racing, Prisons, & Grand Prix (Special Stages will be added in a later difficulty)
once i finish it

-Racing
for racing it's just beat the track with the conditions said in the check being met like get first place or get a certain rank in later difficulties

-Prisons
use Gachaboms to break Egg Capsules, same idea as the Racing but it's mainly rank requirements (there is no other racers in this mode so there isn't a first place to get)

-Grand Prix
this is very similar to the previous 2, just meet the requirements & you get it

-Specials Stages
Not currently available but will be when i finish the Vicious Difficulty but the idea for the check would be to get the chaos emerald

--Items
the items we got are mainly Character Keys & Cup Keys
(with a few bonus junk items, they're just named after items in the game like Sneaker or Orbinaut)

-Cup Keys
These are main progression item as they unlock your Cups, the only cup you start with is Ring Cup
if you don't have up to Egg Cup unlocked i will be able to post a cheat code to unlock all cups if you need it

-Character Keys
These unlock your playable characters but aren't actually required to beat the game
i guess if you want you could just ignore these

-Goal
Depends on the Difficulty but it's mostly just Beat the last available cup

--Difficulties
Only currently released difficulties will be described here

-Relaxed
Select any difficulty, it doesn't matter, you're just here to have fun

Races require at least First Place (i don't want it to be extremely easy)

Prisons don't require any rank, just beat the stage & you get the check

Grand Prixs just require you beat the cup

Goal is just beat the Egg Cup

Check Count: 111 (including goal)

-Intense
The cup count goes from 14 to 30

The minimal difficulty has to be at least Intense

Races require the same as Relaxed (just get first)

Prisons require for you to at least get C Rank or higher

Grand Prix now requires you to beat a Cup in first place

Goal is to beat Recycle B Cup

 Check Count: 239 (including goal)
